<h3 style="margin-top:0px;">Pinegrow subscription payment failed</h3>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>the last payment for your Pinegrow subscription failed recently. Your subscription is still active and the payment will be retried in the next few days.</p>
<p>Please <a href="#" class="update-url external">update your payment information</a>, if needed, so that you can continue to use Pinegrow without interruptions.</p>
<p>Let me know if I can help with anything.</p>
<p>All the best,<br>Matjaz</p>
<p></p>
